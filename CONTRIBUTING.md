When contributing to an open source project, many people have the following
questions:

* [What Should I Contribute?](#what-to-contribute)
* [How Do I Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
* [Who Owns What I Contribute?](#ownership-of-the-code-and-related-assets)
* [How Will I Be Treated?](#code-of-conduct)

This document seeks to address each of these questions in plain language.

## What To Contribute
Work on things that interest you and [fall in line with ZipShare's
vision](https://github.com/zipshare/zipshare#vision)

The kinds of work we're especially interested in are:

* Documentation improvements!
* Feature ideas!
* Bug reports!
* Design feedback!
* Bug fixes!
* New features!

While we do have a [roadmap](https://github.com/zipshare/zipshare#roadmap), if
you're interested in adding a feature or fixing a bug now we're happy to get it
sooner rather than later!

## How To Contribute

Bug reports and feature requests should be created in [the main zipshare
repository](https://github.com/zipshare/zipshare/issues). Issues referencing
these issues will be created in the appropriate repository depending on where in
[the architecture](https://github.com/zipshare/zipshare#architecture) the change
needs to be made.

Documentation improvements, bug fixes, and new features should be submitted as [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the
repository that contained the bad docs, bug, or missing feature.


## Ownership of the Code and Related Assets
Upon submitting a patch or an issue, ownership of that contribution is
transferred to CodeUnion, Inc. Usage of the project falls under the project's
[license](LICENSE).

This is standard procedure on open source projects, and some [even require
signing a document to this
effect](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If
you have any questions or concerns, please direct them to
[hello@codeunion.io](mailto: hello@codeunion.io), or create an issue.

## Code of Conduct

We strongly believe in creating a novice-friendly, welcoming environment where
all contributions are valued and treated with respect. To that end we've adopted
the Contributor Covenant:

### Contributor Code of Conduct

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual
language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public

not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the
Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
